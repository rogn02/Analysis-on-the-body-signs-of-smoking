# Analysis on body signs which indicate smoking
I have used a kaggle dataset on body signs that indicate smoking to run data analytics on and finally make a machine learning model to predict the chances of smoking based on the body signs presented in the given case. The whole process is described in the colab notebook.

## Dataset used:

## Modules used:
#### Pandas
#### Matplotlib
#### Scikit
#### Math
#### Seaborn
#### Warnings
