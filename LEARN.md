# Overview of this project
## In this project,I used a dataset from kaggle which contains various parameters (health based like fasting blood sugar,Cholesterol,etc) and whether the patient is a smoker or not. 
## The steps were as follows:
 - overview of the dataset
 - EDA and parameter selection
 - Model implementation and accuracy based comparison

### Feel free to make any PRs, lets make this a group learning perspective :) 
#### Doubts can be commented within the doubts issue and suggestions within the suggestions issue
